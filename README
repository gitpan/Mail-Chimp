NAME
    Mail::Chimp::API - Perl wrapper around the Mailchimp v1.1 API

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use Mail::Chimp::API;

      my $chimp = Mail::Chimp::API->new($username, $password);

      my $campaigns   = $chimp->campaigns;
      my $lists       = $chimp->lists;
      my $subscribers = $chimp->listMembers($lists->[0]->{id});

      print 'success' if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com', {}, 1);

DESCRIPTION
    Mail::Chimp::API is a simple Perl wrapper around the MailChimp v1.1 API.
    The object exposes the MailChimp XML-RPC methods and confesses fault
    codes/messages when errors occur. Further, it keeps track of your API
    key for you so you do not need to enter it each time.

    Method parameters are passed straight through, in order, to MailChimp.
    Thus, you do need to understand the MailChimp v1.1 API as documented at
    <http://www.mailchimp.com/api/1.1/> so that you will know the
    appropriate parameters to pass to each method.

NOTES
    If you find yourself getting '-32602' errors, you are probably missing a
    required (even if empty) hash. The API documentation should be your
    first destination to verify the validity of your parameters. For
    example:

      # MailChimp Error -32602: server error. invalid method parameters
      print 'fail'    if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com');
  
      # The {} is required by MailChimp to indicate that you do not want any MergeVars
      print 'success' if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com', {}, 1);

    Also, the only security method implemented is login. This is likely to
    change at some point in the future.
