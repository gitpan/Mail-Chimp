NAME
    Mail::Chimp::API - Perl wrapper around the Mailchimp API

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use Mail::Chimp::API;

      my $chimp = Mail::Chimp::API->new(apikey      => $apikey,
                                        api_version => 1.2);

      # or if you have no apikey setup:
      # my $chimp = Mail::Chimp::API->new(username    => $username,
      #                                   password    => $password,
      #                                   api_version => 1.1,
      #                                  );

      my $apikey      = $chimp->apikey;   # generated on first login if none was setup

      my $campaigns   = $chimp->campaigns;
      my $lists       = $chimp->lists;
      my $subscribers = $chimp->listMembers($lists->[0]->{id});

      print 'success' if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com', {}, 1);

DESCRIPTION
    Mail::Chimp::API is a simple Perl wrapper around the MailChimp API. The
    object exposes the MailChimp XML-RPC methods and confesses fault
    codes/messages when errors occur. Further, it keeps track of your API
    key for you so you do not need to enter it each time.

    Method parameters are passed straight through, in order, to MailChimp.
    Thus, you do need to understand the MailChimp API as documented at
    <http://api.mailchimp.com/> so that you will know the appropriate
    parameters to pass to each method.

    This API has been tested with version 1.0 and 1.1 of the API.

NOTES
    If you find yourself getting '-32602' errors, you are probably missing a
    required (even if empty) hash. The API documentation should be your
    first destination to verify the validity of your parameters. For
    example:

      # MailChimp Error -32602: server error. invalid method parameters
      print 'fail'    if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com');
  
      # The {} is required by MailChimp to indicate that you do not want any MergeVars
      print 'success' if $chimp->listSubscribe($lists->[0]->{id}, 'someone@somewhere.com', {}, 1);
